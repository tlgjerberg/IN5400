This dataset is a merge of the Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 set and the PASCAL VOC 2007 set, although the latter has all the images of birds removed.

The dataset is used in the IN5400 lab on image classification and object localization.

The non-bird images do not have a bounding box, while the bird images do.
